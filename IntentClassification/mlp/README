MMIC.ipynb is the jupyter notebook for running the baseline model

The baseline is a Multilayer Perceptron

The jupyter notebook assumes that the training data is uploaded to google drive.
So, run the alfred_training_data_generator.py and then run MLP_data_generator.py.
Upload the generated data to Colab or to google drive and then continue.
